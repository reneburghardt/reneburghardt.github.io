I am a PhD student at the University of Göttingen, mainly advised by <a href="https://sinzlab.org/">Fabian Sinz</a>.

I got my M.Sc. degree in Applied Data Science from the University of Göttingen, Germany (2024), where I worked on latent variable models on inter-area brain communication. Prior to that, I got my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Humboldt University Berlin, Germany (2019).
