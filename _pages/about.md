I am a PhD student at the University of Göttingen, under the primary supervision of <a href="https://sinzlab.org/">Fabian Sinz</a>.

I earned my M.Sc. in Applied Data Science from the University of Göttingen in 2024, where my research focused on latent variable models to study inter-area brain communication. Before that, I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science at Humboldt University of Berlin in 2019.
